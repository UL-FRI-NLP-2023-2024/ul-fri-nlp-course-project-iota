  title    = {An alternative ``description of personality'': the big-five
              factor structure},
  author   = {Goldberg, L R},
  abstract = {In the 45 years since Cattell used English trait terms to begin
              the formulation of his ``description of personality,'' a number
              of investigators have proposed an alternative structure based on
              5 orthogonal factors. The generality of this 5-factor model is
              here demonstrated across unusually comprehensive sets of trait
              terms. In the first of 3 studies, 1,431 trait adjectives grouped
              into 75 clusters were analyzed; virtually identical structures
              emerged in 10 replications, each based on a different
              factor-analytic procedure. A 2nd study of 479 common terms
              grouped into 133 synonym clusters revealed the same structure in
              2 samples of self-ratings and in 2 samples of peer ratings. None
              of the factors beyond the 5th generalized across the samples. In
              the 3rd study, analyses of 100 clusters derived from 339 trait
              terms suggest their potential utility as Big-Five markers in
              future studies.},
