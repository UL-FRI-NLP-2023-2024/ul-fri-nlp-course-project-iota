# Pedagogical Agents for Fostering Question-Asking Skills in Children

[Paper](/review/pdfs/Pedagical%20Agents.pdf)

- Question-asking is an important skill for learning, but children often struggle with it. How can we increase children's question-asking skills with the primary intent of using a virtual agent to foster divergent question-asking skills in children?
- Testing was done on 95 children split into two groups, one with an agent that promotes convergent questions (questions with a single answer, e.g., "What is the capital of Slovenia?") and one with an agent that promotes divergent questions (questions without a single correct answer, e.g., "How might the story of 'Cinderella' change if it were set in the modern day?"). This taxonomy is called QAR (Question-Answer Relationship).
- Design:
  - 3 sessions per week: ABA design (A: baseline, B: intervention, A: post-intervention)
  - In the first session, they see how the children normally ask questions.
  - In B, they are exposed to the agent. They read a text. Then the agents give some **answer** proposals. The children are then asked to create questions that have the same answer as the proposals. One group gets answers that are convergent, the other divergent.
  - In the last session, they evaluate the children's question-asking skills and compare them to the baseline.
- Findings:
  - It doesn't matter which agent the children interacted with; they asked more questions in the post-intervention session than in the baseline session.
  - The children did increase their targeted question-asking skills (so convergent questions for the convergent group and divergent questions for the divergent group) - especially when "pre-prompted" by the agent (the agent says how the question should look like, e.g., it should start with "How might...", "Why...", etc.).
  - More curious children excelled in the divergent group.
  - Intervention (B stage) was enjoyable for the children.
  - There was a significant increase in the fluency of questions asked in the post-intervention session.

## **My thoughts:**

- The authors don't really talk about how the agent was designed...
- Thank you authors for including images in French. Real academic gems.
