# Constructing multidimensional situation models during reading

The paper describes three experiments on 27 psychology students that tested which aspects of a five-dimensional situational model are more important to our experience.
They tested the impact of different aspects by measuring reading time while introducing discontinuities across different dimensions.
The dimensions are:
- time
- space
- causation
- motivation
- protagonist

The reading time increase is very noticeable in all but the spatial dimension.
There, spatial discontinuities did not present a large increase in reading time unless the study participants memorized the map of the story space in advance.

The study confirmed the "processing-load hypothesis" that predicts that the reading time goes up when there is more data to process.
It's very likely that we could take this information into account when constructing a model used for learning by keeping continuities along dimensions that are irrelevant for the learning experience and channeling the focus elsewhere.
