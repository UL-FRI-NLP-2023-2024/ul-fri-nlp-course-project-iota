# Constructing multidimensional situation models during reading
- the paper examines which aspects of a situational model are noticed more often while reading:
  - time
  - space
  - causation
  - motivation
  - protagonist
- they tested that by tracking reading time while changing the linearity of certain aspects
- more noticeable:
  - time
  - causation
  - motivation
  - protagonist
- reading time goes up when discontinuities are presented
- not noticeable in spatial continuity
- processing-load hypothesis
  - the fewer indexes that are shared between the current event being processed and other events, the more difficult it is to incorporate that event into the situation model
  - increases in processing load when there is little overlap
