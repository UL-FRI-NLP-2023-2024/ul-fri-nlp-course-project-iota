# An Alternative "Description of Personality": The Big-Five Factor Structure

[Paper](/review/pdfs/The%20Big%20Five.pdf)

Prerequisites:

- Openness to Experience: imagination, creativity, curiosity, and a willingness to try new things.
- Conscientiousness: organization, dependability, discipline, and a high level of ambition.
- Extraversion: sociability, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, and high levels of emotional expressiveness.
- Agreeableness: being compassionate, cooperative, trusting, and sympathetic towards others.
- Neuroticism: emotional instability, anxiety, moodiness, irritability, and sadness.

- The main point of the paper is to re-inforce the idea that the Big Five is a valid and reliable measure of personality.
- The study is composed of 3 sub-studies:
  - Study 1: The author collected 1431 adjectives to describe personality traits. Participants then rated themselves and other people on these adjectives. Then a factor analysis (varimax rotation of PC) was performed. It revealed that the underlying structure of personality is best described by the Big Five. (Except Neuroticism was replaced with emotional stability which is just the opposite of Neuroticism).
  - Study 2: Similiar to Study 1. 479 trait adjectives were rated by participants. Either self or peer. The results were the same as in Study 1.
  - Study 3 aimed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the Big Five personality traits measurement by refining the selection of trait adjectives. To this end, the study introduced 100 revised synonym clusters, each comprising quasi-synonymous adjectives that are closely related in meaning. These clusters were designed to capture aspects of personality more effectively, aligning with the dimensions of the Big Five model.
