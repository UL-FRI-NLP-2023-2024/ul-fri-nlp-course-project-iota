- analysis of reading comprehension textbooks in the Netherlands:
  - analysis of lessons within textbooks
- analysis of utilisation of these textbooks by teachers:
  - teacher interviews
  - lesson 
- findings:
  - no strong alignment between lesson goals, theory and assignments
  - lessons are focused on exercising
  - no actual knowledge about reading strategies
  - no opportunity to apply strategies yourself
  - teachers are aware of these problems, but do not counteract them
